We have robots that move using controllers, robots that move using gestures, and robots that move

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi to my computer. Then I downloaded VNC, which is a computer software that allows me to access the raspberry pi environment. In VNC, I can write out programs directly to the raspberry pi for it to execute my commands. Because my project requires the use of a camera, I began hooking up a camera module to the raspberry pi. Then, I ran a sample code in the raspberry pi enviroment to test the camera module, and it was able to produce excellent colored images. However, the lag in the enviroment was extremely exasperating. To maneuver around the raspberry pi environment lag, I downloaded Visual Studio code onto my computer and connected it to my raspberry pi. This allows me to write out and run raspberry pi commands directly on my computer, wihtout having to take the extra time to open VNC and the raspberry pi environment. My project uses computer visino to track a moving ball, so we began working on a code that would outline the contours in an image. For my next milestone, I hope to be able to construct my robot, and work out a code that would allow the raspberry pi to detect and outline specific shapes in a RGB image.
